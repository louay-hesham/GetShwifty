The code opens magnet links into your favourite bittorrent client.

This has been tested using Deluge. Other bittorrent clients may require some modifications in the code.

Only works on Unix for now. Windows uses a different set of commands to start an application.

Support for Windows may or may not come in the future (I hate coding on Windows).

I recommend use eztv.io for all your torrent links, you may try other websites if they have the same general layout.
